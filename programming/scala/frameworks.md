## Cats

Cats is a library which provides abstractions for functional programming in the
Scala programming language.

Scala supports both object-oriented and functional programming, and this is reflected
in the hybrid approach of the standard library. Cats strives to provide functional
programming abstractions that are core, binary compatible, modular, approachable
and efficient. A broader goal of Cats is to provide a foundation for an
ecosystem of pure, typeful libraries to support functional programming in
Scala applications.

For more detail about Cats' motivations, go here.

Why "cats"?

The name is a playful shortening of the word category, from
"category theory".

Regardless, you do not need to know anything about category
theory to use Cats.

## Circe

CHEER-chay in Ecclesiastical Latin) is a JSON library for Scala (and Scala.js).
