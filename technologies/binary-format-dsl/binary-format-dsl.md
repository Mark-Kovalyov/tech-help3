## Wireshark

Wireshark is a network protocol analyzer that includes dissectors for over two thousand protocols.

## Preon(Java)

https://github.com/preon/preon

Preon aims to provide a framework for dealing with binary encoded 
data; or more specifically, it aims to deal with situations in which 
bytes are considered to be overkill. The project is named after 
the "point-like" particles, conceived to be subcomponents of 
quarks and leptons. Let's just say very small particles that 
you don't see with the naked eye, but you probably rely on them without knowing.


## Scodec(Scala)

http://scodec.org/

scodec is a suite of Scala libraries for working with binary data. 
Support ranges from simple, performant data structures for working with 
bits and bytes to streaming encoding and decoding.

## Hammer(C)

## BPDL

Binary Parsing Description Language (BPDL): BPDL is a DSL for describing binary data formats that was developed as part of the UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) specification. It provides a way to describe binary structures using a human-readable format, and can be used to generate code in several programming languages, including C++.

## BTL

Binary Template Language (BTL): BTL is a DSL for describing binary data structures. It provides a way to define the structure of a binary file using a text-based format, and can be used to generate code in several programming languages, including C++.

## ASN.1

ASN.1: ASN.1 is a DSL for describing data structures that was developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). It provides a way to describe data structures using a human-readable format, and can be used to generate code in several programming languages, including C++. While ASN.1 is not specifically designed for describing binary file formats, it can be used for this purpose.
