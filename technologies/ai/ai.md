# AI

## Transformers:

Transformers combine some of the benefits traditionally seen with convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs).

* BERT
* GPT-x
* DALL-E
* AlphaFold

## Comp.Vision

* VGGNet,
* AlexNet

## recurrent neural networks for natural language processing and sequencing problems

* LSTMs
* GRUs

## Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

## Models from Databricks
