## Data Lake

Озеро данных принимает любые файлы всех форматов.

A data lake is a central location that holds a large amount of 
data in its native, raw format. Compared to a hierarchical data warehouse, 
which stores data in files or folders, a data lake uses a flat architecture 
and object storage to store the data. Object storage stores data with 
metadata tags and a unique identifier, which makes it easier to 
locate and retrieve data across regions, and improves performance. By 
leveraging inexpensive object storage and open formats, data lakes 
enable many applications to take advantage of the data.
