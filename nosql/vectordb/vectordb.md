# Vector Databases

## Other Links

* Qdrant (read: quadrant ) is a vector similarity search engine and vector database. It provides a production-ready service with a convenient API to store, search, and manage points - vectors with an additional payload. Qdrant is tailored to extended filtering support. It makes it useful for all sorts of neural-network or semantic-based matching, faceted search, and other applications. https://github.com/qdrant/qdrant

## General Info

* Commonly represent unstructured data
  * Videos/text/images
* Usually of high dimension in the form of a dense embedding
* Reduce data size for index and search
* Use "off-the-shelf" models to create

## Threee semantic (text) vectors

```
today is a sunny day

that is a very happy person

that is very happy dog
```

## Distance Metrics

### Cosine similarity

```
cos(t,e) = te / (|t|*|e|)
```

## Vector Database

* Purpose build database to store, index
  and query vector embeddings
  generated by passing unstructured
  data through ML models

* Common indexing methods
  * Flat (brute-force)
  * HSNW (Hierarchical Navigable Small Worlds)
  * FAISS https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss

## Redis Search

* Indexing methods
  * HSNW (ANN) https://github.com/zhao-lang/redis_hnsw
  * Flat (KNN)
* Distance metrics
  * L2, Cosine, internal prod

## PGVector

* Open-source vector similarity search for PG
* Supports exact and approximate NN search for L2
  distance, inner prod, and cosine
